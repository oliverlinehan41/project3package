This is a compilation of various topics I have learned in Stat 302. It includes functions regarding hypothesis testing, linear modeling, and statistical prediction. You can use the following code to install project3package:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("project3package")
```

```{r setup}
library(project3package)
```
